Ghostable is a serverless CLI for local-first environment management:
projects, environments, variables, devices, schema validation, agent guidance,
and signed activity records.

Ghostable keeps environment management local-first and repository-backed.
Encrypted value files, public device records, signed policy, signed activity,
environment keys, and access grants live under `.ghostable/` and are intended to
be committed to git. Private device keys are stored outside the repository in
the platform's native secret store when available, or in a restrictive
file-backed identity store otherwise.

## Install

Install Ghostable once, then run it inside each project you want to manage.

macOS:

```sh
brew tap ghostable-dev/ghostable
brew install --cask ghostable
```

Node/npm projects:

```sh
npm install @ghostable/beta
```

This installs a project-local `ghostable` binary at
`node_modules/.bin/ghostable`.

Other platforms can download the matching archive from the
[latest release](https://github.com/ghostable-dev/beta/releases/latest) and put
the `ghostable` binary on `PATH`.

## Getting Started

From your project directory:

```sh
ghostable setup
```

`setup` is interactive. It prompts for project and device details, creates the
`default` environment, and asks whether to seed that environment from an
existing `.env` file.

## Build

```sh
make build
```

## Basic Flow

```sh
ghostable env push --env default --file .env --reason "Initial default baseline"
ghostable env pull --env default --file .env
ghostable env diff --env default --file .env
ghostable env diff --from staging --to production
ghostable validate --env default
ghostable hygiene report --env production
ghostable review --base origin/main --env production
ghostable deploy production
```

Most options can be omitted in an interactive terminal. Ghostable prompts for
project and device details when needed, and creates the `default` environment
automatically. If `.env` exists, setup asks whether to seed `default` from it.
Automation and agents should pass flags and prefer `--json`.

## Commands

- `setup` initializes `.ghostable/`, a local device record, policy, key metadata files,
  and a private local device identity.
- `status` prints project, environment, device, and value counts.
- `env list|create|delete|push|sync|pull|diff|history`
  manages environment-level workflows.
- `validate` checks environment values against schema rules.
- `review` checks whether code changes, encrypted ENV metadata, and hard-coded
  secret scans agree.
- `deploy [environment]` writes decrypted values to `.env` for deploy scripts.
- `var push|pull|promote|delete|history|context|annotation`
  manages a single variable and its key metadata.
- `schema file|rule|key` manages local validation schema files.
- `hygiene report|rotation|suppress|rotate`
  manages operational hygiene checks, rotation policy, suppressions, and
  environment encryption key rotation.
- `device create|join|list|status|approvers|share|grants|revoke` manages local device
  records, scoped automation devices, and policy grants.
- `agent init|instructions|capabilities` emits safe instructions and a
  recommended read-only/dry-run command allowlist for coding agents.

## Hygiene

`ghostable hygiene report` checks stored variables and environment metadata for
operational hygiene issues. Variable rotation reminders are opt-in through
`.ghostable/hygiene.yaml`; stable config such as `APP_DEBUG=false` is not
reported as stale unless a rotation rule is configured for that key or
`--stale-after` is passed explicitly.

Unused-variable checks are also opt-in because framework and platform
conventions can use environment values without direct code references:

```sh
ghostable hygiene report --env production --unused
```

Set a project-level rotation rule:

```sh
ghostable hygiene rotation set --key STRIPE_SECRET_KEY --days 90
```

Set an environment-specific override:

```sh
ghostable hygiene rotation set --env production --key STRIPE_SECRET_KEY --days 60
```

Rotation intervals are always whole days.

List configured rules:

```sh
ghostable hygiene rotation list
```

The policy file uses the same project-default plus environment-override shape
as validation rules:

```yaml
rotation:
  keys:
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:
      rotationAfterDays: 90
  environments:
    production:
      keys:
        STRIPE_SECRET_KEY:
          rotationAfterDays: 60
```

## Review and Secret Scanning

`ghostable review` scans changed lines for common ENV access patterns in
PHP/Laravel, JavaScript/TypeScript/Node, Go, Python, Ruby/Rails, Java, C#,
Rust, Swift, and shell/deploy scripts. It compares those references with
encrypted Ghostable values, schema files, `.env.example`, and signed
`.ghostable/` records. GitHub Actions workflow references under
`.github/` are ignored because those often come from GitHub Secrets or Vars.

`ghostable review` also runs local hard-coded secret scanning by default. Use
`ghostable review --secrets-only` when you only want the secret scan, or
`ghostable review --env-only` when you only want the ENV metadata checks. The
legacy `ghostable scan` command is still available as a direct secret-scan
path.

Secret scanning uses manifest ignores from:

```yaml
scan:
  ignores:
    - .git/**
    - node_modules/**
    - .ghostable/environments/**/values/**
    - .ghostable/environments/**/keys/**
```

Findings are redacted by default. Use `--json` for machine-readable output.
`--show-values` exists for explicit human debugging, but agents should avoid it
unless the user asks.

## Deploy Scripts

`ghostable deploy production` decrypts the selected environment and writes it to
`.env`. It replaces `.env` by default so stale deploy values do not survive
between runs. Use `--merge` when an existing file should be preserved.

Provider targets use `ghostable deploy <target> [environment] [options]`:

```sh
ghostable deploy laravel-forge production
ghostable deploy laravel-vapor production
ghostable deploy laravel-cloud production
```

Laravel Vapor deploys selected Ghostable values to Vapor environment variables:

```sh
ghostable deploy laravel-vapor production --dry-run
ghostable deploy laravel-vapor production
```

`ghostable deploy laravel-vapor` requires the `vapor` CLI on `PATH` unless
`--dry-run` is used. Variables are merged into Vapor's temporary
`.env.<environment>` file and pushed with `vapor env:push`.

Laravel Cloud deploys selected Ghostable values to Laravel Cloud environment
variables using the Laravel Cloud CLI:

```sh
ghostable deploy laravel-cloud production --dry-run
ghostable deploy laravel-cloud production --cloud-env production
```

`ghostable deploy laravel-cloud` requires the `cloud` CLI on `PATH` unless
`--dry-run` is used. It calls `cloud environment:variables <environment>` with
`--action=set` for each selected key, so existing Cloud variables with matching
keys are updated and missing keys are added. The Cloud environment defaults to
the Ghostable environment name; use `--cloud-env` when Laravel Cloud uses a
different environment ID or name.

Laravel Forge deploys selected Ghostable values to a Forge site's environment
file using the Laravel Forge CLI:

```sh
ghostable deploy laravel-forge production --dry-run --forge-site example.com
ghostable deploy laravel-forge production --forge-site example.com
```

`ghostable deploy laravel-forge` requires the `forge` CLI on `PATH` unless
`--dry-run` is used. It pulls the remote site environment file with
`forge env:pull`, merges selected Ghostable values into a temporary file, then
pushes the result with `forge env:push`. Existing Forge variables with matching
keys are updated and missing keys are added. Pass `--forge-site` with the Forge
site name that should receive the variables.

Deploy systems can use a scoped automation credential instead of a local device
identity:

```sh
ghostable access create --name deploy-bot --kind deploy --grant production:reader
```

Store the returned token as `GHOSTABLE_CI_TOKEN` in the deploy system, commit
the updated `.ghostable/` files, then run:

```sh
ghostable deploy production
```

For Laravel Forge, install Ghostable as an npm package in the project, commit
the `.ghostable/` directory, and store the deploy credential outside the
application directory, such as `/home/forge/.ghostable-ci-token` with `0600`
permissions. Then load it in the deploy script after dependencies are installed
but before Laravel commands that read `.env`:

```sh
npm ci
export GHOSTABLE_CI_TOKEN="$(cat "$HOME/.ghostable-ci-token")"
ghostable deploy laravel-forge production --forge-site example.com
npm run build
$FORGE_PHP artisan migrate --force
```

For Laravel Cloud, run `ghostable deploy laravel-cloud` before starting a Cloud
deployment when changed variables should be available to the next deploy.

## Storage

Committed project files:

```text
.ghostable/ghostable.yaml
.ghostable/policy.json
.ghostable/devices/*.json
.ghostable/environments/<env>/keys/*.json
.ghostable/environments/<env>/values/*.json
.ghostable/events/*.json
.ghostable/hygiene.yaml
.ghostable/schema.yaml
.ghostable/schemas/<env>.yaml
```

Key metadata `position` values are sparse sortable ranks, not dense line
numbers. Generated layouts use gaps such as `1000`, `2000`, and `3000` so a
new key can usually be added without rewriting every existing key metadata
file.

Key annotations are signed plaintext key metadata with explicit `string`,
`number`, or `bool` values. They are intended for non-secret labels that future
custom rules or actions may read.

Value records may include a signed plaintext `change.reason` so reviewers can
understand why an encrypted value changed without exposing the secret.

Local-only private identity:

```text
macOS:      Keychain service dev.ghostable.identity.<project-id>
Windows:    Credential Manager target dev.ghostable.identity.<project-id>
Linux/Unix: ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/ghostable/identities/<project-id>.json
```

When `GHOSTABLE_KEYSTORE` is set, private identity material is written to:

```text
$GHOSTABLE_KEYSTORE/<project-id>.json
```

That fallback directory is created with `0700` permissions and identity files
are created with `0600` permissions.

## Implementation Notes

Value writes use the Ghostable value schema (`ghostable.value.v1`) and the core
cryptographic model: Ed25519 device signatures, X25519 grants, HKDF-SHA256 key
derivation, and XChaCha20-Poly1305 value encryption.
